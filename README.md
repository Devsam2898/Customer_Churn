# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Customer Churn Prediction project. The project aims to build a predictive model to identify potential churners and provide actionable insights to help businesses improve customer retention strategies.

## Project Description

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical challenge for businesses across industries. The goal of this project is to predict customer churn using machine learning algorithms and analyze the key drivers that contribute to customer attrition.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical customer information, including features such as tenure, monthly charges, internet service, contract type, etc. It is available in the `data` folder.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
2. https://github.com/Devsam2898/Customer_Churn.git
3. 
2. Install the required dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
cd customer-churn-project

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, and analysis:

jupyter notebook customer_churn.ipynb


3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code and generate predictions.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the churn dataset (`customer_churn.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model building (`customer_churn.ipynb`).
- `README.md`: This file you are currently reading.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages and versions.


## Results

The project results and analysis are presented in the Jupyter Notebook (`churn_prediction.ipynb`). You can find detailed insights into the model's performance, feature importance analysis, and recommendations for improving customer retention.
