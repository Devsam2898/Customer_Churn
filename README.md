## Overview

Flight booking price prediction is an essential task in the airline industry to help travelers plan their journeys and airlines optimize ticket pricing. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict flight booking prices based on various features such as departure and arrival cities, travel dates, airline, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the data directory. It contains historical flight booking data with features like 'Departure City', 'Arrival City', 'Departure Date', 'Airline', 'Number of Stops', 'Duration', and 'Price' (target variable).

## Installation

To run the code and experiments, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
